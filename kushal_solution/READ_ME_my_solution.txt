Some notes regarding the solution:

python version '3.11.1' was used.

The solution are contained in Task_1.py, Task_2.py and Task_3.py (Cheerry on the cake). I tried to implement my best solution in given time frame and resources.
For task_1 I have uploaded my rotated_pdf with rotation angle. Hope you can see my intuition behind the solution 

All expalinations are availabe in their repective script mostly.

All the imports are available in the requirements.txt file. There is a function in each task file which will call them directly.
For OCR I tried to install different ones like  Easy-ocr, DOCtr, and Tesseract. I couldnt install Easy-ocr and DOCtr because of some system error hence Tesseract is chosen.
 Its nice but might not work on pages with less words :( 

So You might have to install the Tesseract and give the path inorder for solution to work. Here is the guidelines to install Tesseract:

Hope you enjoy the solution :)
